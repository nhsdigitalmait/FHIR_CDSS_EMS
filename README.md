# FHIR_CDSS_EMS
Repository for CDSS/EMS validation configuration of TKW

This project stalled in 2020 - I delivered an instance of TKW and then post 2020 I delivered some updates to them and badgered them for feedback but most of the team seemed to have left - never had a response - assume project to be dead. They used the docker image to update their AWS server which we had no access to.
